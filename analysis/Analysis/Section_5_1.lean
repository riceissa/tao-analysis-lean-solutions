# Analysis I, Section 5.1: Cauchy sequences

I have attempted to make the translation as faithful a paraphrasing as possible of the original
text. When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful
translation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will be places where the
Lean code could be "golfed" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided
doing so.

Main constructions and results of this section:

- Notion of a sequence of rationals
- Notions of `ε`-steadiness, eventual `ε`-steadiness, and Cauchy sequences

  Definition 5.1.1 (Sequence). To avoid some technicalities involving dependent types, we extend
  sequences by zero to the left of the starting point `n₀`.

instance Sequence.instCoeFun : CoeFun Sequence (fun _ ↦ ℤ → ℚ) where
  coe := fun a ↦ a.seq

/--
Functions from ℕ to ℚ can be thought of as sequences starting from 0; `ofNatFun` performs this conversion.

The `coe` attribute allows the delaborator to print `Sequence.ofNatFun f` as `↑f`, which is more concise; you may safely remove this if you prefer the more explicit notation.

If `a : ℕ → ℚ` is used in a context where a `Sequence` is expected, automatically coerce `a` to `Sequence.ofNatFun a` (which will be pretty-printed as `↑a`)
